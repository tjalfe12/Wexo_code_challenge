# Welcome to FlickerHub!

ðŸ“– This is a code challenge showcasing general web development and api interaction. It is created using the full-stack framework Remix.js along with TailwindCSS for styling.

## To run

Please make sure you have VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and NPM (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your machine.

Clone the repository and open the project in VS Code. Then open a terminal and use the following commands to run the website locally:

```shellscript
npm install
```

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Test user
You can login using the following credentials:
```
Username: wexo
Password: challenge
```

Or feel free to create a new user.

### Notes
I have included the .env file and DB access token directly in the repository for ease of use, and since there is absolutely nothing vital to be accessed in the database, but it is of course not standard procedure otherwise.
I included a user management system in the solution, to better handle wishlisting of movies on a permanent and per user basis, allowing users to have different wishlists simultaneously and across different devices.
